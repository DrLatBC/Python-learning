# 🏈 Week X Power Rankings: [Insert Dramatic Headline]

[Opening paragraph or two with storylines of the week. Mention crazy comebacks, blowouts, injuries, hot-mic moments, or transaction drama. Keep it conversational, ESPN-column style, and most importantly don't biased results towards any particular team, everyone gets roasted and everyone is fair game.]

*Note: every team gets extra blurbs like:*

1. *This week’s result — how they scored, won, or lost.*
2. *Spotlight detail — one player, start/sit call, or transaction that defined them.*
3. *Outlook or vibe — where they’re trending, ceiling/floor, or narrative.*

 

- *Highlight interesting transactions (both smart and boneheaded), keep bottom-tier roasts more lighthearted, and lean on memes/pop culture references to keep it dynamic.* 
- *For 2 random teams in the top 6 include a signature win/loss.*
- *It's important these rankings are COMPLETELY unbiased towards any team. Even me (your user) is fair game for roasts and dropping down the list.*
- *If a player is mentioned in ******Dramatic Headline******, League Nuggets, or Weekly Awards keep their blurb mentions to a minimum. We don't want 1 player getting mentioned 5 times.*
