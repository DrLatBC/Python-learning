Zero Sum Shame

This is not your average number guessing game. You'll pick a difficulty, try to find the secret number, and get roasted along the way. The game gives you hints, but it never passes up a chance to talk trash when you mess up.

How it works

Choose a difficulty: easy, medium, hard, or custom.

The game picks a secret number between 1 and your chosen maximum.

You get a limited number of lives to guess it right.

Every wrong guess gives you hot/cold feedback (how close you are) and high/low hints (which direction to go).

And, of course, you'll catch an insult or two.

Features

Preset difficulties with smart defaults.

Custom mode for full control over range and lives.

Hot/Cold system with heat levels ranging from Scorching to Arctic.

Performance rating at the end: Mythic, Clean, Solid, Messy, or Clown.

Rotating insults so the lines don't repeat until they cycle through.

Guess history log so you can review how bad (or good) you were.

Smart input handling: type garbage, get mocked. Nail it fast, get praised.

Example

Pick difficulty (easy/medium/hard/custom): hard
Ok, it's between 1 and 10000 and you have 10 lives, so go nuts.
What is your guess?: 420
Warm... too low, bro beans. | Lives: 10 → 9
What is your guess?: 666
Scorching... too high, dawg. | Lives: 9 → 8
What is your guess?: 500
You got it after 3 tries.
Not perfect, but solid enough, playa.

Notes

This project started as a learning playground and turned into a surprisingly fun game. It's equal parts number guessing, roasting, and chaos.
